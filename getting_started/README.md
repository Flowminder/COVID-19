# Getting started: steps to produce aggregates from CDR data

This section explains the steps required for a mobile network operator to produce the first aggregates and mobility indicators from their CDR data. The guidance is split into two files:

- [producing_aggregates.md](producing_aggregates.md) covers the steps required to calculate the aggregates,
- [producing_scaled_indicators.md](producing_scaled_indicators.md) explains the steps to get from the aggregates to scaled mobility indicators, which can be shared with external parties without revealing any commercially-sensitive information.
