# Getting started: steps to produce aggregates from CDR data

This section explains the steps required for a mobile network operator to produce the first aggregates and mobility indicators from their CDR data. The guidance is split into the following files:

- [01_running_a_test_query.md](01_running_a_test_query.md) details steps to run a test query, to ensure you have identified the correct data structure and are able to run queries,  
- [02_producing_aggregates.md](02_producing_aggregates.md) covers the steps required to calculate the aggregates,  
    - [02b_description_of_queries.md](02b_description_of_queries.md) explains the data processing steps that constitute the initial three aggregate queries. This may be useful for implementing the aggregate queries in a language other than SQL,  
- [03_producing_scaled_indicators.md](03_producing_scaled_indicators.md) explains the steps to get from the aggregates to scaled mobility indicators, which can be shared with external parties without revealing any commercially-sensitive information.
